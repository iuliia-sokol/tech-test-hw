# TweeTest

TweeTest is a basic simple prototype of a web-based social media app.
Due to the app was developed as a technical test within a few days, it's functionality is currently limited to a few small features: 
- User can check the list of top 3 popular users and top 3 active users on the Homepage. The rating is based on the number of followers and tweets respectively.
- User can get a list of all users on the Tweets page and simply filter those he/she follows with the neat  filtering tool. This can be especially helpful to keep an eye out on people you follow, especially if you automatically follow everyone back like I do =)
